# Technical Decision Records (TDRs)

This directory contains Technical Decision Records (TDRs) for the World Demographics Visualization project.

## What are TDRs?

Technical Decision Records document specific technical choices made during development. Unlike ADRs which focus on high-level architecture, TDRs focus on implementation details, libraries, frameworks, and specific technical approaches.
