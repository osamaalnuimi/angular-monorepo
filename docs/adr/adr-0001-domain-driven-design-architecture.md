# ADR-0001: Domain-Driven Design Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As we begin development of the World Demographics Visualization application, we need to establish a clear architectural pattern that will:

1. Promote separation of concerns
2. Make the codebase maintainable and extensible
3. Allow for clear boundaries between different parts of the application
4. Support the visualization of complex hierarchical data
5. Enable effective testing strategies

The application will need to handle complex data transformations, state management, and interactive visualizations, making architectural decisions particularly important.

## Decision

We will adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for structuring our application, with the following layers:

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business logic, entities, and interfaces that represent the problem domain (world demographics data).

   - Location: `libs/visualizations/domain/src/lib/entities/`
   - Examples: `CountryData`, `RegionData`, `ContinentData` interfaces

2. **Application Layer**: Contains application services and facades that orchestrate the use cases of the application.

   - Location: `libs/visualizations/domain/src/lib/application/`
   - Examples: `WorldDemographicsFacade`

3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles external concerns like data fetching, persistence, and external services.

   - Location: `libs/visualizations/domain/src/lib/infrastructure/`
   - Examples: `DataVisualizationService`

4. **UI Layer**: Contains presentational components that are reusable and focused on rendering.

   - Location: `libs/visualizations/ui-circle-packging-visualization/`
   - Examples: `CirclePackingComponent`

5. **Feature Layer**: Contains smart components that compose UI components and connect them to the application layer.
   - Location: `libs/visualizations/feature-world-demographics/`
   - Examples: `WorldDemographicsComponent`

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain
- Domain logic is isolated from UI and infrastructure concerns
- Testing is simplified as components have clear responsibilities
- New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code
- The architecture supports the complex data transformations needed for visualizations

### Negative

- Introduces more complexity and indirection compared to simpler architectures
- Requires discipline to maintain the separation between layers
- May result in more boilerplate code for simple features

### Neutral

- Developers need to understand DDD concepts to work effectively with the codebase
- The architecture may evolve as the application grows and requirements change

## Alternatives Considered

### MVC/MVVM Pattern

While MVC or MVVM would provide some separation of concerns, they don't provide as clear guidance on handling complex domain logic and data transformations.

### Feature-based Organization Only

Organizing solely by feature without the domain/application/infrastructure separation would be simpler but wouldn't provide as clear boundaries for testing and maintenance.

### Redux/NgRx for State Management

Using a centralized state management solution like NgRx was considered, but Angular's signals provide a lighter-weight alternative that's sufficient for our needs.
