# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the World Demographics Visualization project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. Each ADR describes a choice the team has made and the factors that influenced it.
